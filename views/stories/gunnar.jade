h2 Gunnar
p: em He was a tall, powerful man and very skilled in arms. He could strike or throw with either hand and was so quick with a sword that there seemed to be three in the air at once. He was the best of archers, and his arrows never missed their mark. He could jump more than his own height fully armed, and just as far backwards as forwards... it has been said that no man was his match.
p The Icelander Gunnar Hámundarson, the toughest of the Viking Age warriors, stomped out of the book and into my life. I first read about him in a bar in northern Scotland, a favoured pillaging ground of Gunnar’s kinsfolk in the dark old days. I felt the primordial stirrings of hero worship ferment within me. I imagined him bound in a heavy leather jerkin, bound in a lousy woollen cloak, the musty reek of adventure upon him. 
p I will give you just one nugget from the rich seam of Gunnar’s life of heroism. When he was found guilty of murder at the Icelandic parliament, he was given a choice. He could go into exile, or he could be legally murdered by any man who dared attempt it. Gunnar stayed. Fourteen men that tried to impose the court’s ruling were cut down by Gunnar’s axe. Gunnar became my ideal of what to expect from Icelandic men.
p It was with raised eyebrows, therefore, that I took in the sights of Reykjavik. The young men were all somewhere on the hipster spectrum, often well advanced. Skinny jeans in pastel colours were endemic.
p Invoking Gunnar’s name, I put this comparison to a pretty girl in her car as she drove us through the wilds of western Iceland. She dropped a historical bombshell.  
p ‘Yes but this is Reykjavik.’ The girl had sighed, ‘The men are weak. Not the men in the north, where I am from. But it’s so funny you should mention Gunnar Hámundarson, because he is famous as Iceland’s first gay.’
p ‘What? Gunnar ‘gunz and hammerz’ Hamundarson was a gay? Nae chance!’ I said, furious at this accusation. He might belong to another culture, but he is still one of the world’s few heroes. 
p ‘Yes, of course. You must understand,’ she said, keeping at best half an eye on the road as it poured down a valley, the ghosts of crashes past swishing by on either side, ‘homosexuals are new in Iceland, but a few years ago they made Gunnar and Njall into gay icons.’
p ‘But they were both married!’ I protested, moving one hand closer to the wheel, in case she resorted to gesticulation to make her point.
p ‘Married yes. But for years even gay men were marrying. First you marry, for children, then you have sex for fun. It didn’t always have to be with your wife.’
p 
p That night I pulled my battered copy of Njall’s saga from my bag and re-read it through new eyes.
p Let me set it out for you in the basics.
p Njal and Gunnar were very different men. In ages they were distant, Njal being a full generation older than his protégée. In stature too there was a gulf. Njal was a dainty, effeminate beast with ‘one  peculiarity, he could not grow a beard.’ Gunnar was the fierce opposite. Impulsively violent with the strength to back it up, he rode his temper through the saga like a beast he could scarcely control. Theirs was a perfect match of brains and brawn, for Njal’s steady counsel was renowned, and plans he formed rarely failed. 
p Their passage through life was a tumultuous one. In a world where might made right, Gunnar was fated to a life of bloodshed and enmity. Njal’s wise words were ever on hand to settle with politik scores Gunnar had begat through violence. They made their share of enemies, but the hotter the flames of adversity burned the two, the stronger grew their bond. But both were husbands to jealous wives. Both women felt mere seconds to their husbands’ first love of one another. 
p The wives began a feud between their houses. Gunnar’s wife had Njal’s servant murdered. Njal’s wife’s response in kind began a tit-for-tat exchange of bloodshed. But, as with all other challenges, the men bore it together. Each servant’s life was worth an agreed amount in coin. If dawn brought a new corpse, dusk would bring a bag of silver. 
p The two men’s aloofness to the carnage wrought fury in the wives. Facing down both men, Njal’s wife made an accusation. She called them both ‘Argur’, the Old Icelandic word for homosexual. In those days, such an insult could be taken to court, and the death penalty applied if the accusation was false. Njal’s wife must have felt the weight of evidence was with her. 
p Scanning the text, there are more and more interpretable passages. 
p Njal is called upon to make reparations for an unlawful slaying, this time to the lord of a different area. He piles silver coin into a mound, to the agreed amount of the dead man’s worth. He then covers the silver with a personal gift, a soft silken blanket, and departs. The irony of giving a silken blanket, a fabric  traditionally worn only by women, in recompense for a man’s life, raises great humour amongst the aggrieved lord and his followers. ‘I shall tell you what I think’, he says contemplating who had given such a gift, ‘I think it was [Njal] who gave it, Old Beardless, because there are many who cannot tell...if he is a man or a woman.’ 
p It’s a compelling theory, that these two old heroes were so enraptured with one another’s minds and bodies that they became lovers.  Whether it’s true or not, the accusation has changed forever the way people view the action in Njal’s saga.   
p So what now for my hero Gunnar? An afterlife of mockery and post-mortal humiliation? Not a bit of it. Since the 1920’s Gunnar has been to the Icelandic gay community what David Bowie was to the English. But where Bowie tied English homosexuality to the cutting edge, to modernity, Gunnar tethered the Icelanders to a point a thousand years in the past. This has given the conservatively-minded folk a solid reason to accept gay culture, which flourishes here. Indeed on windy days the high street of Reykjavik looks in danger of sailing away on all the unfurled rainbow flags. All thanks to big, scary, multiple-murdering Gunnar. Still a hero, just a different sort of hero.
