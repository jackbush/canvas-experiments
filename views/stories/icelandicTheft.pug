h2 Icelandic Theft
p The toxic loans that had crippled economies across the world had holed the little ship of Iceland below the waterline. Inflation was rampant. An effective pay cut across the whole population had made yesterday’s basics into today’s luxuries. The people found themselves eating bread but paying for gateau. . The digital price signs in supermarkets were increasing so fast they looked like stopwatch readouts.
p When the system failed in Detroit, it became the murder capital of the world inside a couple of years. The good folk fled as the city burned behind them. The destitute human residue became addicted to crap drugs like crack.
p During the Weimar hyperinflation workers formed themselves into a ‘Red Army’ fifty-thousand strong to wage a general war on the shite state of things. 
p My first sightseers amble down the high street was like a passage into an alternate reality. Up high the summer sun had his hat on, and was bouncing his merry rays off brightly painted boutiques. Bouquets of flowers burst up in technicolour response from the ranks of plant pots. Young, pretty girls stalked the streets in the latest fashions. Peering through the glass-fronted shops, I saw that even basic items, hairbrushes and rucksacks and things, had phone-number price tags. 
p What surprised me most were the bicycles. Every single bicycle –and I mean every one of the scores that choked up the alleyways and bike stands like horses in the Old West – was unlocked.  
p Before the volcano, Iceland had been trailed heavily in news stories and running tickers at train.
p It was four years since Iceland had withdrawn its currency from international markets and dissolved parliament. So why, when the town is as insecure as a broken-fronted vending machine, are the people still feeding their coins assiduously into the slot? Icelanders, I learned during my stay, have a little circle of cowardly hell reserved for thieves. It is a cultural prejudice of great antiquity. A beautiful example of the general low-esteem in which thieves were held is found in Egil’s saga. 
p Egil was one of the great warrior poets of the sagas. He would compose staves of verse as sloshing beer thinned the dry blood out of his beard.  A natural leader of men, he took to helming raids into Norway.  His boat was like a coach full of violent football hooligans on an away weekend. Singing, drinking and ‘harrying, and putting in at divers points’ to slaughter the surprised and ill-prepared opposition. These raids greatly edified young Egil. 
p His cock-sure team put ashore in a heavily forested county and split up into rampaging packets. Egil and his unit of twelve fighters set to raiding a large farm-house that stood alone amongst fields. To their surprise, the whole compound was empty. Taking such easy pickings as they could, they struggled back outside to find they were surrounded. It had been a trap. 
p Egil himself was stood on the front porch of the house, holding a barrel of pilfered mead and wearing, presumably, quite a guilty expression. He was being faced down by all the fighting mean of the region. 
p These men fell upon Egil’s unit mercilessly. They left few survivors. Egil, obviously, and a very few injured and weary comrades found themselves locked in a basement beneath the house, awaiting execution at dawn. 
p Naturally, Egil being a true saga hero there were no earthly bounds that could bind him for long. He and his men were soon free. They collected their unguarded treasure as their erstwhile captors drunkenly celebrated their victory upstairs, and made off for their ship. 
p But Egil was after more than treasure. He was building a reputation. He would be loath to tarnish it with something as sneaky and underhand as thieving. Dropping the mead-barrel he had claimed as bounty, he counselled his men.
p 'Our going is all wrong, and not warlike’ he lamented, “We have stolen the [farmer’s] property without his knowing thereof. Never ought that shame to be ours. Go we back to the house, and let him know what hath befallen.'
p His fellow warriors being of spineless non-hero stock, told him to fuck off. They pointed out that they had the treasure and were almost at the boat. They pointed out the heap of dead the raid had already cost. But Egil was unmoved. He stormed back to the farm himself, intent on glory or death. 
p Armed with stolen weapons, he approached the great feasting hall. He built up a pile of wood by the exit, then set fire to the thatch and the door. Egil waited, armed and ready, for the full fighting force of the region to come at him. Many men, bleary with the smoke and the heaviness of wine, did try to charge through the flames at Egil. They were mutilated and slain one after another. 
p ‘At this the [farmer] thought to steal out in the dark, but Egil was near, and dealt him his death-blow, as he did to many others. Brief moment was it ere the hall so burned that it fell in. Most of those who were within perished.’
p Egil returned to his men and ship gloriously, having satisfied his noble-minded spirit.
p So if you covet thy neighbours goods, you may take it. But you must first murder him, his family and all his relations. It is also worth burning down his home for good measure. Icelanders today, being paragons of modernity, generally decline to take part in such wholesale slaughter, and simply leave other peoples stuff alone. And that is why the bicycles have no locks.
