h2 Holiday Romance
p I first thought Victoria’s Secret had been filming a mass battery of adverts in the town. The directors having declared a wrap, a hoard of international models had been loosed upon the shy and reluctant town of Reykjavik. I ignored the distractions of car horns and cyclists making evasive manoeuvres around me as I personally and individually fell in helpless, eternal love with every one of them. 
p There she goes – the love of my life! – sashaying out of a café. She was alone, but smiling coyly as if her lover had just whispered something romantic in her ear. Maybe she was just smiling at the lovely feeling begat by being gorgeous. Yes, I think I’d be smiling too if I were in charge of those smooth skinned arms and gently rolling breasts. And to be blessed with the good sense to house them within that turquoise vest top.  I had to go and speak to her. 
p I barged across the road to another fanfare of disgruntled toots, and almost had my toes decapitated by a cyclist. The brief concern for the ten little piggies’ welfare meant that the cyclist was already ten feet away and moving fast before I realised she should be my wife. She was surely God’s own creation. I watched agape as her lithe back rippled with the gentle strain, partly revealed in her loose emerald dress. Her long bare legs stroked at the pedals, whisking her away from me. I began to chase after her.
p In my rush I failed to see a girl of my own age arranging flowers outside a shop. She blocked my passage, and stood up to get out of the way. Rising, she give a gentle smile that almost knocked me down.
p Excuse me, she said in English, clocking me for a tourist. Her burst of wild red hair harmonised with her eyes that were as blue as spring water in pure visual poetry. 
p Its…that’s…no bother, I stammered. I felt the love utterly swamp my heart and felt it capsize into my stomach, there burning in the acids. 
p I felt paranoid, ugly and out of place. It’s a poisoned chalice, this strutting about freely in a city teeming with Belles. It’s like being invited to the Oscar’s; everyone is better looking than you by an incalculable factor, they are better dressed and almost certainly better financed and it makes you feel very small. That is Reykjavik. 
p  I collapsed at the outdoor table of a café to remove myself from it all. There was a male waiter. He’d been sculpted from the same clay as his female compatriots. He had cheekbones like glimmering razor blades. I slightly fancied him. To banish these worrying thoughts, I asked him why on earth the girls here were beautiful. He frowned disapprovingly, but answered my question diplomatically enough. ‘I think maybe the museum is the place. They can help you learn about Icelandic peoples’. I wondered if his sharp cheekbones gave his girlfriend a close-cut Brazilian during oral. I didn’t feel I knew him well enough to ask. 
p I drank a coffee to steel my shocked constitution, and plodded my route to the museum. Reykjavik is not a big town, and it quickly runs out of steam once you move away from the condensed pretty centre and up the hill. The upshot being that the museum, although just fifteen minutes from the centre, stands alone at the top of its own hill. It is a huge mirrored dome, with strange cylindrical pillars, also dazzlingly reflective, ringing it. It squats there for all the world like an observatory with rocket boosters strapped to its edges. As if the astronomers, during Reykjavik’s many overcast nights, can simply press a button and fire up the rockets, rising the whole colossus above the clouds to make easier their observations. 
p It is a modern more than a romantic structure. A wholly surprising place for a man like me to fall in love. The setting, it turned out, was the least strange thing of my whole holiday romance.  
p After artfully dodging the ticketing desk (where they wanted £13 for entry!) I darted through the entrance door to where the expensive secrets were kept. I felt very brave and daring, and was congratulating myself on my quick wittedness, when I noticed there no information panels. I had to return, pink cheeked, to the entrance to collect an audioguide. 
p The audio guide directs you between displays. Tableaux of family units, all doing alternately filthy or difficult things around a traditional house. Little girls with matted hair gnawing at chicken bones at the feet of hirsute men wielding hammers, battering furnace-hot steel into shape, are constructed with revolutionary model-making techniques. Latex skin that looks every bit as real as blood-filled flesh is set moving by gently heaving lungs, replicated by the most delicate and silent of machinery, and eyes, oh the eyes! They are hand-painted, but so confoundingly exact as to have me staring one model straight on in the face for the best part of a minute, waiting for the actor to flinch. It is like a pagan nativity scene in a very well-to-do parish. 
p I was beguiled beyond words at this fabulous place, I was directed to exhibit three, by the disembodied voice of the guide. 
p There she was. A girl of no more than my own twenty three years, crouched on a stair, body folded loosely and flexibly about her. Her face was turned upwards, as if receiving some mystical signal from the creator. Pale skin that couldn’t have seen anything harsher than soft linen and moonlight since its inception was framed by a fire of the reddest hair, combed into silk down her back.
p Lord she was beautiful. I walked over, flicking the pause button on the mp3 guide, to let her introduce herself to me. A small placard read Melkorka Mýkjartansdóttir. 
p Hello Melkorka, I said, sitting on the step next to her and watching her for a reaction. 
p Where do you come from? I asked, flicking the mp3 back to ‘play’
p Melkorka was taken at the age of fifteen as a prospective mistress by an Icelandic trader on business in Norway...began the guide.
p I liked that, ‘prospective’ mistress. I looked again at those pure satin cheeks and otherworldly expression, as if she was communing with nature herself. 
p I imagine you were a prospective prospect precipitately prospected, I said to her, smiling to myself because she couldn’t. 
p It was common in those times for a man to have one or more mistresses or thralls, I learned. Hoskaldur Dalakolsson was one such man. He was a wealthy and ambitious trader, who spent each winter in Norway amongst the court of king Hakon. Despite being married with many children in Iceland, he spent a small fortune on Melkorka. She was extremely expensive for a concubine, especially she was considered defective, being both deaf and dumb.
p This acquisition caused tension between Hoskalder and his wife when he returned home. Despite this, he kept Melkorka in his house, and soon fathered children to her. Small wonder there was marital tension, I reflected. Imagine the poor wife sitting by the fire with her husband. After ooking bored and restless for a while, he stands up abruptly, rubbing his hands with a twinkle in his eye. ‘Excuse me dear’ he might’ve said ‘I’m going to nip next door and impregnate the concubine.’ Strange times. 
p One day, some years later, Hoskaldur was walking across his land when he heard voices near the river. Going over to investigate, he saw his concubine talking to their young illegitimate son. He approached them, advising the girl that her secret was exposed, and asking her name. ‘If you ask to know my name, it is Melkorka,’ was the girl’s reply. Asked why she had feigned dumbness, she responded that she had been taken from her home in Ireland, where she was a princess, by a Viking raid and sold into slavery. 
p Hoskaldur had a stately house built for Melkorka, nearby his own, to acknowledge her royal blood. History fails to record his wife’s reaction to this. 
p Melkorka, it seems, was a very lucky girl. More than half of the original female settlers were thralls abducted from defeated Celtic tribes, either in Scotland or Ireland. Viking’s, it seems, couldn’t convince enough women to sacrifice a steady life in Norway for the unknown quantity of Icelandic settlement. When they went raiding, they were after  breeding stock as well as treasure and tools.
p Perhaps this explains the ferocity of the Viking raids. They were probably charging up the beaches with axes overhead and hefty erections pointing straight at the town. 
p When they won battles they could literally help themselves to the women. You can bet they never took the ugly ones. That is why Icelandic women are so mythologically sexy. They are almost a genetically engineered meta species, the crème de la crème of Northern European women. and my dear Melkorka is perhaps the most beautiful and famous of them all. 
p I'll never forget you, melkorka, I said, reaching out and squeezing her hand.
p Don’t touch the models, said a museum attendant.
